Benchmark Email Lite lets you build an email list from your WordPress site, and easily send your subscribers email versions of your posts and pages.

== Description ==

If you want your blog to reach every reader, you have to use email. The Benchmark Email Lite WordPress Plugin builds an email list right from the pages of your WordPress site, and sends your subscribers email versions of your posts and pages in a flash. See when, where, and who opens or clicks on links or unsubscribes—all live from your WordPress dashboard!

With this version you can:

* Control up to 5 separate Benchmark Email accounts.
* Build your list of subscribers with a custom signup form widget or shortcode.
* Send test emails of your blog post before deciding on the final send.
* Easily send or schedule a formatted email version of your blog posts.
* View live reports of opened, bounced, unsubscribed, forwarded, and unopened email as well as clicked links.

**From Blog to Email:** Available as an easy-to-integrate widget, this signup form allows subscribers to sign up for email versions of your blog posts with just their email address. You can further customize the signup form with 27 additional fields (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Address, Phone, etc.). If a user signs up and they're already a subscriber, the widget automatically updates the person's data in your email list.

**Themes to Match Your Blog:** You want a signup form that looks like your blog, right? The Benchmark Email Lite widget uses standard HTML list items so you can code your CSS to make the widget match your blog’s design. Most themes will automatically match your signup form to the style of your blog.

**Fully Customizable, Anywhere on Your Blog:** Administrative controls allow you to fully customize the signup form. Choose which email list you want signups to be added to. Best of all, the signup widget can be placed on any page you want—or even every page of your site.

**Test Versions of Your Email:** Send yourself a test email before sending the content to your subscribers. The Plugin's interface inside your post/page editor enables you to email a simple version of your posts (including images) the moment that you finish creating them on your site. Customize the email, From name and subject line when you send to achieve email marketing perfection.

**Formatted Email Versions of Your Blog:** Once you're done testing, select a contact list from the Benchmark Email Lite Plugin and click send! The formatted email version of your blog will be sent to your subscribers right away. You can also schedule your email to be sent at a later date and time.

**View Live Reports:** Once an email is sent, you can see the live reports of its success from within your WordPress dashboard. Learn who opens your emails, clicks on links, unsubscribes and forwards your blogs to friends—even see which email contacts bounce and where your subscribers are reading from.

To get started, sign up for a [FREE Benchmark Email account](http://www.benchmarkemail.com/Register "Try Benchmark Email FREE"). This account will allow you to have up to 2,000 contacts and send up to 14,000 emails per month. You can use the Plugin and fully experience what Benchmark Email has to offer, including our Mobile Marketing iPhone App, Surveys, Polls and Autoresponders. We know you'll love what you see, so once you out-grow your free account you can still use the Plugin free of charge for as long as you’d like. The Plugin is integrated via API with your Benchmark Email account. You may control up to 5 Benchmark Email accounts from a single WordPress site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q1: Where do I go for help with any issues? =

Please call Benchmark Email at 800.430.4095.

= Q2: How do I get the signup form shortcode to use on pages or posts? =

Open a new or existing signup form widget instance by dragging onto any sidebar of your theme or the "inactive widgets" sidebar. Dink down (open) the widget contents and copy the shortcode provided at the bottom of the widget. Paste the shortcode onto any page or post for the signup form to appear inline.

= Q3: Why did the widget suddenly stop connecting with Benchmark Email? =

Please check your API key. We observed on 11/09/2011 that our own API key was deleted/reset on Benchmark Email's server. We had to generate a new one and place the new key code into our widget settings. To generate a new API key, log into Benchmark Email via their website and go to My Account, then Account Settings, then scroll towards the bottom of the page.

= Q4: Why am I seeing "Error Connecting..." in the admin area? =

To combat occasional Benchmark Email API server slowdowns causing sluggish behavior in the WordPress admin area on pages containing this plugin's features, we added a feature to disable connectivity if the plugin detects a 10 second or greater delay in any given connection attempt. Disablement lasts for 5 minutes. The connection timeout can be customized to a value greater than 10 seconds via the plugin settings page. This error can also be triggered by your web host providing slow outbound connectivity, or your web host throttling your PHP processing speed due to other problems with your site, such as memory leaks or heavy traffic. Despite delays, subscriptions are never lost thanks to our queueing system.

= Q5: How do I control which page(s) the widget appears on, or subscribe to multiple lists? =

The widget supports subscriptions to multiple lists or even multiple Benchmark Email API accounts. You may use our optional setting to limit the Plugin to a single page, or use the JetPack module "Widget Visibility" to create visibility rules for a single widget instance. You may also configure multiple instances of the widget and title each instance for the list it corresponds to.

= Q6: How can I customize the email template? =

In version 2.4.3 we added a filter `benchmarkemaillite_compile_email_theme` to permit email template customization using external code, such as a theme or plugin. In version 2.4.5 we added an email template editing interface for users who know enough HTML code to apply their own customizations in the admin area Email Template tab. For earlier users of the filter technique or those who modified the sample template file directly, we recommend switching to the new tool by disabling or removing any external customizations and applying them with the new tool. The new tool automatically embeds WP core CSS and applies HTML normalization.

= Q7: How do I make the form match my theme? =

The signup form uses standard HTML list items so it can be manipulated by CSS within your theme to match your site's design. Some themes will automatically style the widget to match the design. Contact the designer of your theme if you are having difficulties getting the form to match your theme, or add your own child theme with CSS (or a plugin with a CSS editing feature, such as Jetpack) to custom style the elements. The main classname value is `benchmarkemaillite_widget`.

= Q8: Where do I go to change the double opt-in confirmation email text? =

1. Log into your Benchmark Email account.
1. Click on Emails, Contacts, then click on My Signup Forms.
1. Either create a new signup form or click to edit an existing form for the list in question.
1. Complete the section titled "Opt-in Mail".

= Q9: What happens if a subscriber resubmits their subscription? =

If the subscriber's email address preexists on the list, this will update the other fields, if enabled on your widget and populated by the user.

= Q10: Why do I occasionally get "Successfully Queued Subscription"? =

This occurs when the Plugin is not able to immediately connect with the Benchmark Email API server at [http://api.benchmarkemail.com](http://api.benchmarkemail.com "Test Connection to Benchmark Email API"). To remedy this occasional problem, we built in a connection failover capability to queue subscriptions into a CSV file stored in the Plugin folder, and automatically attempt to unload the queue every 5 minutes until successfull to the Benchmark Email API server. We also created a [monitoring job via Pingdom](http://stats.pingdom.com/ta1roodo4tet/345893 "View Monitoring Status").

= Q11: Why are the Extra 1 and Extra 2 fields no longer available? =

Benchmark Email changed the default fields associated with newly created lists in mid 2011. The fields Extra 1 and Extra 2 became Date 1 and Date 2 on new lists created after that date. Users are able to change their list's field titles and types by clicking the Edit link on any list, then clicking Advanced. However, this plugin does not currently support non-default settings. We had to eliminate the Extra 1, Extra 2, Date 1, Date 2 options in order to comply with default settings before and after said change to the defaults.

= Q12: Why did you switch to double opt-in starting in v1.0.4?  =

Two reasons. First, Benchmark Email requested that we use this method because it ensures list quality, which in effect keeps everyone out of trouble and keeps their prices down. Second, in the event somebody unsubscribes and chooses "Do Not Contact" checkbox and gets placed on the Master Unsubscribe List, they can only be removed from this list by the Benchmark Email customer opening a ticket for removal or the subscriber re-subscribing with a confirmed double opt-in method. This provides an easy way for somebody to re-subscribe.
